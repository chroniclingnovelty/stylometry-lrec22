Data and code of the LREC 22 publication Identifying Copied Fragments in an 18th Century Dutch Chronicle


We apply computational stylometric techniques to an 18th century Dutch chronicle to determine which fragments of the
manuscript represent the author’s own original work and which show signs of external source use through either direct copying
or paraphrasing. Through stylometric methods the majority of text fragments in the chronicle can be correctly labelled as either
the author’s own words, direct copies from sources or paraphrasing. Our results show that clustering text fragments based on
stylometric measures is an effective methodology for authorship verification of this document; however, this approach is less
effective when personal writing style is masked by author independent styles or when applied to paraphrased text.
